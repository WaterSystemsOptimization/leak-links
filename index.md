## General Process
### 1. Start and submit survey on site (Survey123 App)
Use the Survey123 application on your tablet or phone to start and submit a survey for every leak. Minimum required fields are:

- Location using map (**Remember**, you can automatically get address by holding down on the map)  
- Picture 1 (Site)
- Picture 2 (Closeup)
- Remaining fields visible in the survey (excluding "Office Fields" and "Geographic Information" group)  

### 2. Complete remaining fields in office (Reference map)  
Use the "Smart Editor" button in the top left of the reference map application to edit the attributes of the selected leak. 

### 3. Generate report (Survey123 Website)  
Use the "Report" button to generate the report. Adjust as necessary in Microsoft Word.  

### 4. Complete missing fields in spreadsheet (Google Sheets)  
Typically this is only `Report #`, `Parcel`, `Map`, and `Zone.
